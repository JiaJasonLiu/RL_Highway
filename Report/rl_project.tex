% if you need to pass options to natbib, use, e.g.:
% \PassOptionsToPackage{numbers, compress}{natbib}
% before loading rl_project.

% to compile a camera-ready version, add the [final] option, e.g.:
 \usepackage[final]{rl_project}

% to avoid loading the natbib package, add option nonatbib:
\usepackage[nonatbib]{rl_project}
% \usepackage[numbers]{natbib}

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % allow utf-8 input
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}    % use 8-bit T1 fonts

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\maketitle

% should be no longer than seven pages including figures but excluding references and appendices.

\section{Problem Definition (1 Page)}
A clear, precise and concise description of your chosen problem, including the states, actions, transition dynamics, and the reward function. You will lose marks for an unclear, incorrect, or incomplete problem definition. You should also discuss
the difficulty of your chosen problem and justify why it cannot be solved effectively using tabular reinforcement learning methods.

\subsection{States}

\subsection{Actions}

\subsection{Transition dynamics}

\subsection{Reward function}

\subsection{Difficulty and challenges}



\section{Background (< 1 Page)}
A discussion of reinforcement learning methods that may be effective at solving your chosen problem, their strengths and weaknesses for your chosen problem, and any existing results in the scientific literature (or publicly available online) on your chosen problem or similar problems.

\section{Method (2 Page)}
A description of the method(s) used to solve your chosen problem, an explanation of how these methods work (in your own words), and an explanation of why you chose these specific methods.

Students should demonstrate a good understanding of their chosen method(s) and give reasonable justifications for their algorithmic choices. This should include demonstrating a reasonable appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods.(60\%)

Students may show evidence of creativity in their algorithmic approach and analysis. Students should demonstrate a deep understanding of their chosen method(s), as well as possible alternative approaches. (70\%)

\section{Results (1 Page)}
A presentation of your results, showing how quickly and how well your agent(s) learn (i.e. improve their policies). Include informative baselines for comparison (e.g. the best possible performance, the performance of an average human, or the performance of an agent that selects actions randomly).

\section{Discussion (< 2 Page)}
An evaluation of how well you solved your chosen problem.

Students should thoroughly evaluate the performance of their agent(s), and include comparisons with key baselines and some alternative approaches.(60\%)

Students should perform an in-depth evaluation of their chosen method(s) and include comparisons to and evaluations of additional baselines and alternative methods.(70\%)


\section{Future Work (0.5 Page)}
A discussion of potential future work you would complete if you had more
time.

\section{Personal Experience (0.5 Page)}
A discussion of your personal experience with the project, such as difficulties or pleasant surprises you encountered while completing it.

If you have additional content that you would like to include in the appendices, please do so here.
There is no limit to the length of your appendices, but we are not obliged to read them in their entirety while marking. The main body of your report should contain all essential information, and the content in the appendices should be clearly referenced where it's needed elsewhere.
